## REQUIRED MODS (&amp; why)
- **Pehkui** (because multiple races are different sizes than standard, and the druid's wild shape allows you to change size): <https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui>
- **Origins: Classes** (because many classes use abilities built into Classes): <https://github.com/MerchantPug/origins-classes/tree/chore/1.20.2> **\*\*\*NOTE!** Must be using the 1.20.2 fork
- **Extra Origins** (specifically only for the druid's wild shape, to make mobs neutral towards you while you're in animal form. If you don't intend to play a druid, or don't care if mobs still attack you while shifted, this mod isn't necessary): <https://modrinth.com/mod/extra-origins>
