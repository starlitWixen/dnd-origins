More information about each race and class and their abilities can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/starlitWixen/dnd-origins/wiki).

## REQUIRED MODS (&amp; why)
- **Pehkui** (because multiple races are different sizes than standard, and the druid's wild shape allows you to change size): <https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui>
- **Origins: Classes** (because many classes use abilities built into Classes): <https://github.com/MerchantPug/origins-classes/tree/chore/1.20.2> **\*\*\*NOTE!** Must be using the 1.20.2 fork
- **Origins Extra Keybinds** (because boy do we use a lot of keys): <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins-extra-keybinds>
- **Extra Origins** (specifically only for the druid's wild shape, and halfing nimbleness. If you don't intend to play a druid or a halfling, this mod isn't necessary): <https://modrinth.com/mod/extra-origins>

## Credit
Thanks so much to Nobody (Discord: chloeisnobody) for allowing me to use the teleportation power from the Better Enderian pack in D&amp;D Origins! 

## What does "Single-Player" mean in this context?
Good question! The only content of the pack affected in this version is the Artificer and the Wizard; in the main version of the pack, the Infusions you can learn as an Artificer are divided up into different specializations, and the spells you can learn as a Wizard are divided up and made exclusive to various schools of magic, limiting the total number of infusions/enchantments you can learn to encourage diversity within any given server, and to keep any one player from becoming too overpowered. In the single-player version of the pack, this specialization/school division does not exist, and any one Artificer can learn any and all Infusions, while any one Wizard can learn any and all enchantments! While this change is intended to enchance the single-player Artificer/Wizard experience, this doesn't mean this version of the pack must be exclusively used in single-player servers; it's just up to the server admins and their priorities for their players.
